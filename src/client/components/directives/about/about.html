                    <p>I'm Nathan-Jamahiel Nelson, a full-stack designer/developer with a passion for powerful, minimal code and efficient living.</p>
                    <p>I've learnt the importance of simply building, and I believe that full immersion is the best (only) way to learn anything.</p>
                    <p>Intermittent fasting and LCHF are fun topics of mine and am always happy to debate what exactly efficient living means.</p>
